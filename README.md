1. [Siril](http://free-astro.vinvin.tf/index.php/Siril): *able to convert, pre-process images, help aligning them automatically or manually, stack them and enhance final images*
2. [Aligning and stacking LOTS of images](http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys373/lectures/align/align_scripts.html): *set of Perl scripts*
3. [alipy](http://obswww.unige.ch/~tewes/alipy/index.html): *This is a python package to quickly, automatically, and robustly identify geometrical transforms between optical astronomical images, using only field stars. The images can have different pixel sizes, orientations, pointings and filters.*
4. [AsPyLib](http://www.aspylib.com/): *collection of tools written in Python for amateur astronomers, that allows FITS image processing and photometry of variable stars and asteroids*
5. [Clustering Based Feature Learning on Variable Stars](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160208977M): *first unsupervised feature learning algorithm designed for variable stars*
6. [FITS Image Software Packages for image viewing, analysis, and format conversion](http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_viewer.html)
7. [ccdproc](https://github.com/astropy/ccdproc): *provides many of the necessary tools for processing of ccd images*
8. [astropyp](https://github.com/fred3m/astropyp): *Astropyp is a python package designed to aid observers in processing and analyzing astronomical images.*
9. [arghphot](https://github.com/balbinot/arghphot): check it out, could be of use.
10. [photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io): tools for detecting and performing photometry of astronomical sources
