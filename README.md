### Software

1. [Siril](http://free-astro.vinvin.tf/index.php/Siril): *able to convert, pre-process images, help aligning them automatically or manually, stack them and enhance final images*
2. [Aligning and stacking LOTS of images](http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys373/lectures/align/align_scripts.html): *set of Perl scripts*
3. [alipy](http://obswww.unige.ch/~tewes/alipy/index.html): *This is a python package to quickly, automatically, and robustly identify geometrical transforms between optical astronomical images, using only field stars. The images can have different pixel sizes, orientations, pointings and filters.*
4. [AsPyLib](http://www.aspylib.com/): *collection of tools written in Python for amateur astronomers, that allows FITS image processing and photometry of variable stars and asteroids*
5. [Clustering Based Feature Learning on Variable Stars](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160208977M): *first unsupervised feature learning algorithm designed for variable stars*
6. [FITS Image Software Packages for image viewing, analysis, and format conversion](http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_viewer.html)
7. [ccdproc](https://github.com/astropy/ccdproc): *provides many of the necessary tools for processing of ccd images*
8. [astropyp](https://github.com/fred3m/astropyp): *Astropyp is a python package designed to aid observers in processing and analyzing astronomical images.*
9. [arghphot](https://github.com/balbinot/arghphot): ???
10. [photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io): *tools for detecting and performing photometry of astronomical sources*
11. [reproject](https://github.com/astrofrog/reproject): Python-based Astronomical image reprojection
12. [LEMON](https://github.com/vterron/lemon/): *differential-photometry pipeline, written in Python, that determines the changes in the brightness of astronomical objects over time and compiles their measurements into light curves. The aim of this program is to make it possible to completely reduce thousands of FITS images of time series in a matter of only a few hours, requiring minimal user interaction.*
13. [Photometry Pipeline (PP)](https://github.com/mommermi/photometrypipeline): *Python software package for automated photometric analysis of imaging data from small to medium-sized observatories*
14. [VaST: a variability search toolkit, Sokolovsky & Lebedev (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170207715S): *software package designed to find variable objects in a series of sky images*
